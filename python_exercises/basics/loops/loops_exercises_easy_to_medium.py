LOOPS EXERCISES – EASY TO MEDIUM LEVEL (SOLUTIONS)
--------------------------------------------------

This file contains the full solutions for:
- for loops
- while loops
- loops + conditions

Each exercise is solved with clean, readable code.

def count_to(n):
    """
    Prints all numbers from 1 up to n (inclusive).
    Using a simple for loop.
    """
    for number in range(1, n + 1):
        print(number)



def sum_to(n):
    """
    Returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n.
    Must be computed manually using a loop.
    """
    total = 0
    for number in range(1, n + 1):
        total += number
    return total



def count_vowels(text):
    """
    Counts how many vowels appear in the string 'text'.
    Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y (case insensitive).
    """

def countdown(n):
    """
    Prints a countdown from n down to 0 using a while loop.
    Prints "GO!" when finished.
    """
    while n >= 0:
        print(n)
        n -= 1

    print("GO!")
